# bel_namelist
 A simple namelist mod created for Stellaris. Made under version 3.0.3, but should be compatible with any version of the game due to the mod adding just the namelist.
 
 Uses "Belfast" only for names of ships, leaders, ship class names and planet names. Also uses some British Navy fleet names for the fleet names.
